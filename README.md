# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service or product) based on key customer features, including age, tenure (how long the customer has been with the company), and gender. Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, as retaining existing customers is generally more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project demonstrates how to approach churn prediction using a simple machine learning model, and also provides a bonus feature of a Streamlit web app for real-time predictions.

### What is Churn Prediction?
Customer churn prediction is the process of using data analytics and machine learning to predict the likelihood that a customer will leave a company or service. By analyzing customer data such as behavior, demographics, and interaction history, businesses can identify patterns that are indicative of potential churn. Predicting churn allows companies to take proactive steps to retain high-risk customers, ultimately improving customer retention rates and maximizing lifetime value.
